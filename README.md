# WordJumbleSolver
This is a word jumble puzzle solving program written in Racket, a language in the Lisp-Scheme family.
It takes a word jumble puzzle in the form of a list of strings, where each string is a row in the puzzle.
It finds all words in the linuxwords.txt file that are present in the puzzle.
A requirement when making this was for it to finish running with proper results within 30 seconds for puzzles up to size 15x20 or 20x15, which it was able to meet.
